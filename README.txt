Implemented features:
- Created a 3D model of a bird with all required primitive shapes and calls to position. Used 10+ primitives and 6 levels of hierarchy.
- Designed UI to view and control bird, as well as modify rendering qualities.
- Created knobs that controls the head (on X and Y rotation) and wings.
- The knob for the wings extends the wing to mimic a realistic bird-wing movement. It extends outward when going up, and extends to the inside when going down, with appropriately calculated acceleration.
- Created an animation that mimics the flight of a bird. The head, wing and body movements of the bird have been adjusted to seem natural and realistic.
- "Artifact - eagle" is a BMP image file showing an eagle looking at the camera with its wings extended. "Artifact - birds" is a gif which shows all of the birds and how they look animated.
- Implemented Speed Adjuster
- Implemented FPS Adjuster
- Added four types of birds: Blue Finch, Northern Cardinal, American Goldfinch, Bald Eagle
